# 📚 Research Paper Repository — CAST Project

This repository collects and organizes scientific papers that support the CAST
(Charging Availability Sequence Transformer) research project.  
Papers are organized into two core categories:

- ✅ Generic Papers → Technical foundations (Deep Learning for sequence modeling)
- ✅ Focused Papers → Applications to EV charging forecasting

A progress tracker is also included for each paper.
