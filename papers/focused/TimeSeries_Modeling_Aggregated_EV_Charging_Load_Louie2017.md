## 🎯 Objective
Analyze and model **electrical load** patterns generated by EV charging stations to support:

- Infrastructure planning  
- Grid stability management  
- Load forecasting strategies  

---

## 🧠 Key Contributions
- ✅ Uses **aggregated charging load** data for forecasting
- ✅ Compares **multiple time-series approaches**:
  - ARIMA
  - Seasonal models
  - Linear regression
- ✅ Provides **temporal behavior insights** for grid operators
- ✅ Highlights **cyclic and seasonal EV charging patterns**

---

## 🧪 Methodology

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Data | Aggregated station-level charging load |
| Techniques | ARIMA-based forecasting |
| Features | Seasonal (daily/weekly) patterns considered |
| Evaluation | Residual error analysis and goodness-of-fit metrics |

Focus is primarily on **short-term load forecasting**, not availability.

---

## 📈 Results
- Forecast accuracy decreases during **peak usage hours**
- Higher EV penetration increases **demand variability**
- Seasonal patterns highly **predictable** in off-peak periods

Graphical results show:
📉 More demand → more unpredictable

---

## ✅ Strengths
- Good baseline study for **temporal EV usage**
- Foundational justification for smarter forecasting models
- Highlights problem complexities relevant to CAST

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- **Does not** forecast:
  - Individual station usage
  - Charging point availability (Busy/Free)
- Limited feature set beyond aggregate load
- Classical models insufficient during peak volatility

---

## 🤝 Relevance to CAST Project
✔ Supports motivation: **charging demand is predictable but nonlinear**  
✔ Shows need for **deep learning** for peak-hour accuracy  
✔ Provides context for dataset considerations:
- Time-of-day importance
- Seasonal weekly patterns
